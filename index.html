           <p>Sometimes we go on family trips like when I’m on a break from school and they don’t work we go to places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, or fun places like universal studios. There are some places that I would love to go in the future it is like my dream vacation to go there. My dream is to go to the universal studios in Orlando Florida because it is bigger and has more rides and more.
